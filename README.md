This folder contains the code artifacts associated with the SELFNET Self-Protection Use Case.

Objectives: Design and implementation of sensors and actuators to provide self-protection capabilities of the network against distributed cyber-attacks, which can be put into operation by means of a botnet. This folder provides the installation of a Command & Control (C&C) Server making up a given botnet as well as a Java application that can be executed to recruit real or fake/cloned zombies in the botnet. This Java application can be used to start-up real zombies, installed in users' devices, or as a mitigation strategy to emulate real zombies' behaviour and thus prevent the execution of cyber-attacks.
